    <p>Letra: Make you mine<hr>
    <br>
    Well, I will call you darlin' and everything will be okay<br>
    'Cause I know that I am yours and you are mine<br>
    Doesn't matter anyway<br>
    In the night, we'll take a walk, it's nothing funny<br>
    Just to talk<br>
    <br>
    Put your hand in mine<br>
    You know that I want to be with you all the time<br>
    You know that I won't stop until I make you mine<br>
    You know that I won't stop until I make you mine<br>
    Until I make you mine<br>
    <br>
    Well, I have called you darlin' and I'll say it again, again<br>
    So kiss me 'til I'm sorry, babe, that you are gone and I'm a mess<br>
    And I'll hurt you and you'll hurt me and we'll say things we can't repeat<br>
    <br>
    Put your hand in mine<br>
    You know that I want to be with you all the time<br>
    You know that I won't stop until I make you mine<br>
    You know that I won't stop until I make you mine<br>
    Until I make you mine<br>
    <br>
    You need to know<br>
    We'll take it slow<br>
    I miss you so<br>
    We'll take it slow<br>
    It's hard to feel you slipping (You need to know)<br>
    Through my fingers are so numb (We'll take it slow)<br>
    And how was I supposed to know (I miss you so)<br>
    That you were not the one?<br>
    <br>
    Put your hand in mine<br>
    You know that I want to be with you all the time<br>
    You know that I won't stop until I make you mine<br>
    You know that I won't stop until I make you mine<br>
    Until I make you mine<br>
    <br>
    Put your hand in mine<br>
    You know that I want to be with you all the time<br>
    Oh darlin', darlin', baby, you're so very fine<br>
    You know that I won't stop until I make you mine<br>
    Until I make you<br>
    La-la-la-la<br>
    La-la-la-la-la-la<br>
    La-la-la-la-la<br>
    La-la-la-la-la-la<br>
    La-la-la-la-la<br>
    La-la-la-la-la-la<br>

    <p>Letra: 2036<hr>
    <br>
    <br>Mulher gostosa é o que tem
    <br>Mas é ela quem eu procuro
    <br>Nenhuma delas é igual você
    <br>Vamos sair pra outro mundo
    <br>Vamos ter um filho no meio do mar
    <br>Perto das ondas que eu criei
    <br>Perto das ondas que eu criei
    <br>Surfando as ondas que eu criei
    <br>
    <br>O tempo ele some, a fama te ilude
    <br>O dinheiro consome a alma mais pura
    <br>Eu te dei essa vibe, bem vindo ao meu mundo
    <br>Sou o presente e eu vivo o futuro
    <br>Tá tudo tão lindo em 2036
    <br>Em 2036, em 2036, em 2036
    <br>Shawty tem tudo aqui na minha sala de estar
    <br>Mas eu vou pra onde você tá
    <br>Eu tô cansado de falar
    <br>Eu tô cansado de só digitar, bae
    <br>
    <br>Ai, ai, calma
    <br>Pode ficar à vontade
    <br>Baby fica calma
    <br>Nenhum dicionário define essa raba
    <br>Bebe do meu copo e vai pra Nárnia
    <br>Zig-zag nessa Kawasaki
    <br>Você me ama igual Kiki
    <br>Você tá fria igual a Siri
    <br>Só você tira isso de mim
    <br>
    <br>O tempo ele some, a fama te ilude
    <br>O dinheiro consome a alma mais pura
    <br>Eu te dei essa vibe, bem vindo ao meu mundo
    <br>Sou o presente e eu vivo o futuro
    <br>Tá tudo tão lindo em 2036
    <br>Em 2036, em 2036, em 2036
    <br>O tempo ele some, a fama te ilude
    <br>O dinheiro consome a alma mais pura
    <br>Eu te dei essa vibe, bem vindo ao meu mundo
    <br>Sou o presente e eu vivo o futuro
    <br>Tá tudo tão lindo em 2036
    <br>Em 2036, em 2036, em 2036
    <br>Shaw-shawty tem
    <br>Shaw-shawty tem tudo aqui na minha sala de estar

        <p>Letra: There Is a Light That Never Goes Out<hr>
        <br>
        Take me out tonight<br>
        Where there's music and there's people<br>
        And they're young and alive<br>
        Driving in your car<br>
        I never, never want to go home<br>
        Because I haven't got one<br>
        Anymore<br>
        <br>
        Take me out tonight<br>
        Because I want to see people<br>
        And I want to see life<br>
        Driving in your car<br>
        Oh, please don't drop me home<br>
        Because it's not my home, it's their home<br>
        And I'm welcome no more<br>
        <br>
        And if a double-decker bus<br>
        Crashes into us<br>
        To die by your side<br>
        Is such a heavenly way to die<br>
        And if a ten ton truck<br>
        Kills the both of us<br>
        To die by your side<br>
        Well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine<br>
        <br>
        Take me out tonight<br>
        Take me anywhere, I don't care<br>
        I don't care, I don't care<br>
        And in the darkened underpass<br>
        I thought, "Oh God, my chance has come at last<br>
        But then a strange fear gripped me<br>
        And I just couldn't ask<br>
        <br>
        Take me out tonight<br>
        Oh, take me anywhere, I don't care<br>
        I don't care, I don't care<br>
        Driving in your car<br>
        I never, never want to go home<br>
        Because I haven't got one, la-di-dum<br>
        Oh, I haven't got one<br>
        Oh, oh<br>
        <br>
        And if a double-decker bus<br>
        Crashes into us<br>
        To die by your side<br>
        Is such a heavenly way to die<br>
        And if a ten ton truck<br>
        Kills the both of us<br>
        To die by your side<br>
        Well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine<br>
        <br>
        Oh, there is a light and it never goes out<br>
        There is a light and it never goes out<br>
        There is a light and it never goes out<br>
        There is a light and it never goes out<br>
        There is a light and it never goes out<br>
        There is a light and it never goes out<br>
        There is a light and it never goes out<br>
        There is a light and it never goes out<br>
